            * prominently state any changes to the files
            * don't remove any license, patent, etc. notices
            * if a file "NOTICE" is contained, derivative work should provide it as well

Overall evaluation: using the licenses of the dependencies poses no restrictions
on using HyperGraphOS with either an open soruce license or a commercial
one. The GoJS licensing situation however should be communicated to recipients
of the software.
